# Dynamic linking Dart SDK in `package:webcrypto`

**GENERATED FOLDER DO NOT MODIFY**

This folder contains sources from the Dart SDK allowing `package:webcrypto` to
dynamically link against native Dart APIs. Contents of this folder is generated
using `tool/update-dart-sdk.py` which clones the Dart SDK and copies over the
files required for dynamic linking.

Files in this folder are subject to `LICENSE` from the Dart SDK project.

Notice that this folder does NOT contain all source files from the Dart SDK
project. Only source files required to build `package:webcrypto` have been
retained. This is essential to minimize package size. For additional source
files and information about the Dart SDK refer to the [Dart SDK repository][1].
