# av_foundation

`av_foundation` is the full featured framework for working with time-based audiovisual media on iOS.
Using av_foundation, you can easily play, create, and edit QuickTime movies and MPEG-4 files, play
HLS streams, and build powerful media functionality into your apps.

All the features in this plugin come from the [AVFoundation](https://developer.apple.com/av-foundation/)
dependency.

This package is still under construction and is missing some features. See documentation for a list
