# android_media

Provides Android classes that manage various media interfaces in audio and video. The Media APIs are
used to play and, in some cases, record media files. This includes audio (e.g., play MP3s or other
music files, ringtones, game sound effects, or DTMF tones) and video (e.g., play a video streamed
over the web or from local storage).

Other special classes in the package offer the ability to detect the faces of people in Bitmaps
`FaceDetector`, control audio routing (to the device or a headset) and control alerts such as
ringtones and phone vibrations `AudioManager`.

All the features in this plugin come from the [android.media](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/media/package-summary)
dependency.

*Note:*
This package is still under construction and is missing some features. See documentation for a list
of available classes.
