# android_hardware

Provides support for Android hardware features, such as the camera and other sensors. Be aware that
not all Android-powered devices support all hardware features, so you should declare hardware that
your application requires using the [\<uses-feature\>](https://developer.android.com/guide/topics/manifest/uses-feature-element)
manifest element.

All the features in this plugin come from the [android.hardware](https://developer.android.com/reference/android/hardware/package-summary)
dependency.

**Note:** This plugin is still under development, and some APIs might not be available yet.
